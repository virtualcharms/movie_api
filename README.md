# movie_api

A python mini-lab: build a simple Django app with Django templates.

-You need at least 1 model with full CRUD.

-You can seed your app using the admin interface, or by writing a migration to do so.

-Build a frontend that can access the API (React or Vanilla Javascript).

-If you're up for a bit of a challenge and want to work as a team:

-You may do the mini project with the addition of file uploads to AWS S3. To get set up for this, you'll need to follow the instructions in this repo: https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-323/aws-s3-setup-guide
